API Status Codes
Status codes are returned with every request that is made to a web server. Status codes indicate information about what happened with a request. Here are some codes that are relevant to GET requests:

200: Everything went okay, and the result has been returned (if any).

301: The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint name is changed.

400: The server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don’t send along the right data, among other things.

401: The server thinks you’re not authenticated. Many APIs require login ccredentials, so this happens when you don’t send the right credentials to access an API.

403: The resource you’re trying to access is forbidden: you don’t have the right permissions to see it.

404: The resource you tried to access wasn’t found on the server.

503: The server is not ready to handle the request.
